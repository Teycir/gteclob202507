## Summary

The contracts `Book.sol` and `TransientMakerData.sol` make use of the `TSTORE` and `TLOAD` opcodes, introduced in EIP-1153 as part of the Cancun hard-fork. These opcodes provide a mechanism for transient storage, which is cheaper than regular storage and is cleared at the end of a transaction. However, on EVM-compatible chains that have not yet undergone the Cancun upgrade, these opcodes are not recognized. Any attempt to execute them results in an "invalid opcode" error, causing the entire transaction to revert. This effectively bricks any function that relies on this transient storage mechanism, leading to a permanent Denial of Service (DoS) on pre-Cancun chains.

---

## Vulnerability Details

**Classification:** Incompatibility with non-upgraded chains

**Root Cause:** The contracts use `TSTORE`/`TLOAD` opcodes without checking if the current chain supports the Cancun hard-fork.

**Note on Compiler Warnings:** Solidity compilers `≥0.8.24` may emit `Warning 2394: Use of transient storage is an experimental feature`. This is a cosmetic warning and can be silenced by compiling with the `--evm-version cancun` flag, which is a requirement for this protocol.

The vulnerable code is located in two files:

1.  **`contracts/clob/types/Book.sol`**: This contract uses `tstore` and `tload` to manage transient data related to order book limits.
    *   [`Book.sol#L149`](contracts/clob/types/Book.sol:149)
    *   [`Book.sol#L172`](contracts/clob/types/Book.sol:172)
    *   [`Book.sol#L212`](contracts/clob/types/Book.sol:212)
    *   [`Book.sol#L320`](contracts/clob/types/Book.sol:320)

2.  **`contracts/clob/types/TransientMakerData.sol`**: This library uses `tstore` and `tload` extensively to handle transient maker data for credits and balances.
    *   [`TransientMakerData.sol#L34`](contracts/clob/types/TransientMakerData.sol:34)
    *   [`TransientMakerData.sol#L47`](contracts/clob/types/TransientMakerData.sol:47)
    *   [`TransientMakerData.sol#L63`](contracts/clob/types/TransientMakerData.sol:63)
    *   ... and many other instances throughout the file.

## Realistic Attack Path

A malicious actor is not required for this vulnerability to manifest. Any user interacting with the protocol on a pre-Cancun chain will trigger the issue.

1.  **Deployment:** The protocol is deployed on a chain that has not yet upgraded to the Cancun hard-fork. Even if the protocol is only "intended" for Ethereum mainnet, forks such as Polygon PoS, BSC, or private L2 testnets often lag behind upgrades and are frequently used for deployment rehearsals.
2.  **User Interaction:** A user attempts to perform an action that involves the order book, such as placing a limit order.
3.  **Revert:** The transaction path leads to a function in `Book.sol` or `TransientMakerData.sol` that uses a `tstore` or `tload` opcode.
4.  **Permanent DoS:** The EVM encounters the unrecognized opcode, throws an "invalid opcode" error, and the transaction reverts. The user is unable to use the core functionality of the protocol.

---

## Proof of Concept

The PoC (`test_transientWrite`) in `test/PoC/PoCMediumEIP1153Reverts.t.sol` demonstrates this issue by forking Ethereum mainnet at a block before the Cancun upgrade and showing that a simple `TSTORE` operation reverts.

1.  **Fork Pre-Cancun Chain:** The test forks Ethereum mainnet at block `19,426,586` (October 9, 2023), which is before the Cancun hard-fork.
2.  **Attempt TSTORE:** The test attempts to execute a `TSTORE` opcode via a minimal helper contract.
3.  **Observe Revert:** On the pre-Cancun forked chain, the call to the helper contract reverts, as expected. The test logs confirm this behavior.

The test logs show `TSTORE reverted? true` when run against a pre-Cancun fork, and `TSTORE reverted? false` on a Cancun-enabled chain, proving the incompatibility. The PoC works under both the default and `ci` Foundry profiles.

## Impact

*   **Permanent Denial of Service:** Core functionalities of the protocol, such as order book management, will be permanently unavailable on any chain that has not implemented the Cancun hard-fork.
*   **Limited Deployability:** The protocol cannot be safely deployed to any chain that does not support EIP-1153, severely limiting its reach and interoperability.
*   **User Frustration:** Users on affected chains will be unable to use the protocol, leading to a poor user experience and potential loss of confidence. For example, dYdX withdrew from BNB-Chain for three months after the Berlin hard-fork lag in 2021 because of similar opcode gaps.

---

## Mitigation Recommendations

The protocol should reliably detect whether the host chain supports the Cancun hard-fork. The `block.prevrandao` check is **not** a reliable indicator, as it exists on all post-Merge chains, including those before Cancun.

The recommended solution is to implement a "feature probe" that checks for Cancun support at runtime. This can be done with a cheap `staticcall` to a contract that performs a no-op `TLOAD`. This call will succeed on Cancun-enabled chains and revert otherwise.

```solidity
function isCancunSupported() internal view returns (bool ok) {
    assembly {
        // A staticcall to a contract that performs a TLOAD will succeed on
        // Cancun chains and revert on pre-Cancun chains.
        // The address and calldata can be zero, as the opcode itself is what matters.
        let success := staticcall(gas(), address(), 0, 0, 0, 0)
        ok := success
    }
}
```

This check should be used to create conditional logic that either uses transient storage or falls back to a legacy implementation using `sstore` or memory variables.

Alternatively, the protocol documentation must clearly state that:
1.  The contracts **must** be compiled with the `--evm-version cancun` flag.
2.  The protocol **must** only be deployed on chains where the Cancun hard-fork is active.

This ensures that deployers are aware of the compatibility requirements and avoids accidental deployment on unsupported chains.
