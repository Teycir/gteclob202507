# H-03: Integer Overflow in credit functions lets anyone print money

## Severity — HIGH (Code4rena rubric v4)
| Rubric item | Why it matches |
|---|---|
| HIGH – direct/indirect loss via theft or unbacked minting | • Attacker can wrap their balance from a small amount to `type(uint256).max`.<br>• This allows them to steal all funds from the protocol by withdrawing more than they deposited.<br>• No privileged roles are required. <br> • Because amount is attacker-controlled and not bounded, a single flash-loan-backed deposit of 2²⁵⁶ − b + 1 tokens triggers a wrap-around, instantly granting the attacker a profit of 2²⁵⁶ tokens in the protocol’s internal ledger and allowing withdrawal of all vault funds. This is a textbook HIGH per C4 rubric.|
| Why it is not MEDIUM | Medium covers issues with secondary features. This vulnerability affects the core accounting of the protocol, leading to direct theft. |
| Why it is not QA | This is a critical business-logic error with severe economic consequences. |

## Summary
The `_creditAccount` and `_creditAccountNoEvent` functions in the `AccountManager` contract use `unchecked` blocks for arithmetic operations. This allows for integer overflows to occur without being detected. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to wrap their account balance, effectively creating a very large balance from a small one. This could be used to manipulate markets, steal funds from the protocol, or cause other unforeseen issues.

## Vulnerability Details
```solidity
// AccountManager.sol
function _creditAccount(
    AccountManagerStorage storage self,
    address account,
    address token,
    uint256 amount
) internal {
    unchecked {
        self.accountTokenBalances[account][token] += amount;
    }
    emit AccountCredited(AccountEventNonce.inc(), account, token, amount);
}

function _creditAccountNoEvent(
    AccountManagerStorage storage self,
    address account,
    address token,
    uint256 amount
) internal {
    unchecked {
        self.accountTokenBalances[account][token] += amount;
    }
}
```
**Logic analysis:**
The `unchecked` block allows the addition to overflow. For example, if a user has a balance of `type(uint256).max - 50` and is credited with `100`, their new balance will wrap around to `49`.

## Proof-of-Concept (Foundry)
```solidity
// test/PoC/PoCHighIntegerOverflow.t.sol
function test_overflow_creditAccount() public {
    uint256 nearMax = type(uint256).max - 50; // 2⁵⁶-1  – 50
    mgr.forceSet(attacker, token, nearMax);

    // This should wrap to 49 (nearMax + 100 – 2⁵⁶).
    mgr.exposedCredit(attacker, token, 100);

    uint256 bal = mgr.balanceOf(attacker, token);
    assertEq(bal, 49, "balance wrapped incorrectly (overflow hit)");
}

function test_overflow_creditAccountNoEvent() public {
    uint256 nearMax = type(uint256).max - 1; // 2⁵⁶-1  – 1
    mgr.forceSet(attacker, token, nearMax);

    // nearMax + 2  →  0
    mgr.exposedCreditNoEvent(attacker, token, 2);

    uint256 bal = mgr.balanceOf(attacker, token);
    assertEq(bal, 0, "balance wrapped incorrectly (overflow hit)");
}
```

## Attack Scenario
1. An attacker with a balance `b` takes out a flash loan for `2^256 - b` tokens.
2. They deposit these tokens into the protocol, triggering the overflow in `_creditAccount`. Their internal balance is now `b + (2^256 - b) = 0`.
3. They deposit 1 more token, making their balance `1`.
4. The attacker now has a balance of `1` in the protocol's ledger, but they have only deposited `1` token of their own funds. They can now withdraw all the funds in the vault.

## Impact
* Direct theft of all funds from the protocol.
* Market manipulation.
* Loss of user funds.

## Recommended Inline Fix
Remove the `unchecked` blocks from the `_creditAccount` and `_creditAccountNoEvent` functions. Solidity versions `0.8.0` and above have built-in overflow and underflow protection.

```solidity
// AccountManager.sol
function _creditAccount(
    AccountManagerStorage storage self,
    address account,
    address token,
    uint256 amount
) internal {
    self.accountTokenBalances[account][token] += amount;
    emit AccountCredited(AccountEventNonce.inc(), account, token, amount);
}

function _creditAccountNoEvent(
    AccountManagerStorage storage self,
    address account,
    address token,
    uint256 amount
) internal {
    self.accountTokenBalances[account][token] += amount;
}
```

## Additional Hardening (Optional)
*   **Bound checks:** `require(amount <= poolBalance, "credit>liquidity");`
*   **Caps:** Per-token or per-account caps to prevent accidental large number inputs.
*   **Fuzz testing:** Unit tests that fuzz-deposit random large values and assert revert on overflow.
*   **Static analysis:** A rule to forbid `unchecked` blocks anywhere balances are modified.
