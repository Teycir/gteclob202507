## M-02  Infinite Loop in Order-Matching ⇒ Gas Denial-of-Service  

---

### ✧ Severity Justification (C4 Rubric v4)

| Rubric Item | Why the Issue Matches |
|-------------|-----------------------|
| **MEDIUM — “Bricks core functionality”** | Submitting an order whose `amount < lotSizeInBase` causes an endless loop that consumes all gas. Matching for that market side becomes unusable until the offending order is removed. |
| Not HIGH | No direct theft / loss of funds. Impact is liveness, not value-extraction. |
| Not QA   | The bug is in critical matching logic and is externally triggerable. |

---

### 📋 Description

* In `Book.sol` the helpers `_matchIncomingBid` and `_matchIncomingAsk` compute the tradable size rounded **down** to whole lots.  
* If `incoming.amount` is **smaller** than `lotSizeInBase`, the rounded amount (`fillBase`) becomes **`0`**.  
* The branch

```solidity
if (fillBase == 0) {
    continue;      // ← re-enters loop without progress
}
```

does **not** decrease `incoming.amount`. The `while (incoming.amount > 0 …)` loop therefore never terminates, causing every call to run out of gas → **gas-DoS**.

### 🗂️ Location of the bug

| # | Contract File | Function | Lines \* | Faulty Statement | Problem |
|---|---------------|----------|---------|------------------|---------|
| 1 | `contracts/clob/types/Book.sol` | `_matchIncomingBid` | ~730-770 | `if (fillBase == 0) { continue; }` | Leaves `incoming.amount` intact ⇒ infinite loop when amount < lot size |
| 2 | `contracts/clob/types/Book.sol` | `_matchIncomingAsk` | ~770-815 | `if (fillBase == 0) { continue; }` | Same issue on the ask side |

### 🔍 Vulnerable Code Snippet

```solidity
uint256 fillBase = _roundDownToLot(
    incoming.amount < maker.amount ? incoming.amount : maker.amount,
    lotSizeInBase
);

if (fillBase == 0) {
    continue;               // 🔥 infinite loop, incoming.amount unchanged
}

incoming.amount -= fillBase; // never reached when fillBase == 0
```

### 🧪 Proof-of-Concept

A minimal Foundry test reproduces the revert caused by gas exhaustion.

```
test/PoC/PoCMediumInfiniteLoopGasDos.t.sol
```

Run:

```bash
forge test --match-path test/PoC/PoCMediumInfiniteLoopGasDos.t.sol -vv
```

**Expected (pre-patch):**

```
Low-level call success flag : false   // OOG revert confirms DoS
```

After applying the fix (below), the test passes.

### 🛠 Recommended Fix

Replace `continue` with a loop-terminating action in **both** helpers:

```diff
- if (fillBase == 0) {
-     continue;                  // infinite loop
- }
+ if (fillBase == 0) {
+     break;                     // exit gracefully (or revert AmountTooSmall())
+ }
```

Optional hardening:

```solidity
if (incoming.amount < lotSizeInBase) revert AmountTooSmall();
```

This gives users an immediate, cheap revert instead of even one loop iteration.

### 🎯 Impact

* **Permanent liveness failure** — “dust” orders (< 1 lot) can freeze matching.  
* **Unbounded gas griefing** for any caller interacting with the matcher.  
* **Liquidity & UX degradation** as small trades can never settle.
